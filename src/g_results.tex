\chapter{Results} \label{Chap:Results}

Explain the results of your thesis.

\section{Testing Analysis}
How you took last row of each data. etc. etc.... Error is calculated based on an equation given below. Concern with position alone therefore taking last row alone. Which is then plotted after summary.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Plot window with better legends.
    \item Plot with absolute errors rather than percentages.
    \item Lack of independent parameters.
    \item \sout{Say here that the aperture size was this and this.}
    \item \sout{Do I say something about the corrected as well as old setup here?}
    \item \sout{What reason should I provide for the old setup?}
    \item Why did I only do x, y movement for the hexapod? Why was z movement not performed?
    \item \sout{Why did we only move 0.3 mm?}
    \item Because we are moving 0.3 mm, the repeatability error of hexapod with value \SI{\pm0.5}{\micro\meter} can be ignored? How much is the percentage of error? 0.1667\%
    \item \sout{Put the quadrant diagram for performed movements here.}
    \item Why rotations were not done? My answer because of NCC.
    \item Put research questions for the next chapter.
    \item \sout{Talk about laser diameter used for our experiments.}
    \item \sout{Explain transformation matrix.}
    \item \sout{Add images explaining difference in MIG for different exposure times.}
    \item \sout{Explain how exposure time and gain affects MIG.}
    \item \sout{Sobel operations on very dark and bright images}
    \item \sout{Add photos to experimental setup.}

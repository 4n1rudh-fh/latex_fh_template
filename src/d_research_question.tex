Different speckle pattern quality algorithms have been assessed in the literature, but there is a lack of definition of a perfect speckle pattern. This is because of the insufficient control on error sources that can influence its appearance. It is also to be noted that majority of the literature talks about quality of artificial speckle pattern (for e.g. speckle pattern created from airbrushing black paint on a surface) instead of \gls{lsp}.

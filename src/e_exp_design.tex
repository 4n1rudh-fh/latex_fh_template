\chapter{Experimental Design}

Explain how you came to design the setup for your experiments.

\section*{To-Do}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Say here that the aperture size was this and this.
    \item Do I say something about the corrected as well as old setup here?
    \item What reason should I provide for the old setup?
    \item Why did I only do x, y movement for the hexapod? Why was z movement not performed?
    \item Why did we only move 0.3 mm?
    \item Because we are moving 0.3 mm, the repeatability error of hexapod with value \SI{\pm0.5}{\micro\meter} can be ignored? How much is the percentage of error? 0.1667\%
    \item Put the quadrant diagram for performed movements here.
    \item Why rotations were not done? My answer because of NCC.
\end{itemize}

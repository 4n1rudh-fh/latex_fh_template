\chapter*{Abstract}


Robots are at the forefront of research, where applications are being tested to use them for manufacturing purposes, such as \gls{lmp}. But, there inherent positional inaccuracies can result in producing sub-optimal outcomes. Therefore, with the purpose of countering this issue, a sensor concept involving a camera and a laser module is developed. 

\vspace{5mm}
\noindent This project focusses on mimicking relative movement between robot \gls{tcp} and a given surface within a controlled setup. The idea is, that by integrating this sensor, the issue of positional inaccuracies within a robot will be addressed. Findings from the conducted research show promising results, and in the future this sensor concept can find it's use in a wide range of industries, where precise robotic functions are of necessity.

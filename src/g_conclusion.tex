\chapter{Conclusion}

Write the conclusion, future scope and limitations of your work.


\begin{itemize}
    \item Lack of independent parameters.
    \item Why did I only do x, y movement for the hexapod? Why was z movement not performed?
    \item Because we are moving 0.3 mm, the repeatability error of hexapod with value \SI{\pm0.5}{\micro\meter} can be ignored? How much is the percentage of error? 0.1667\%
    \item Why rotations were not done? My answer because of NCC.
    \item Put research questions for the next chapter.
\end{itemize}

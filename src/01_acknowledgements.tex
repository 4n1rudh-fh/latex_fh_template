\noindent Firstly, I would like to thank my supervisors Prof. Dr. rer. nat. Felix Hüning and Mr. Philipp Walderich. Professor Hüning always provided me honest feedback and constant support during the course of the thesis. His encouragement, to trying, learning and acquiring new skills, gave me motivation to go above and beyond my current capacities. Under Philipp, I found a constant source of great counsel and the dedication to excellent scientific research. His guidance, helped me find the solutions, whenever I felt stuck somewhere. He has been very instrumental in shaping of this thesis. I would also like to extend my thanks to Mr. Leon Gorißen, who always provided me with detailed input and feedback, which have been very invaluable in writing of this thesis. His friendly presence and willingness to assist with any questions or concerns, were a beacon of comfort. I would also like to thank Mr. Jan-Niklas Schneider and Mr. Thomas Kaster, who helped me provide essential equipment to realize my experimental setup and also my peers at the RWTH Digital Photonic Production (DPP) group. Their gestures of inclusion and thoughtfulness, not only helped me acclimate in an unfamiliar setting, but also enriched my overall experience.

\noindent I would also like to extend my appreciation for my friends, who were always there for me. During challenging days, when stress weighed me down, their humor and shared laughter, became a much-needed remedy, and instantly lifted my spirits. Lastly, I would like to express my deepest gratitude for my parents, who believed in me and without whom, this journey would not be possible.

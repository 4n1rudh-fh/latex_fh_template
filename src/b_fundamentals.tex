    \section{Camera Technology}

    The \glsfirst{emva} developed a \gls{emva} 1288 Standard which helps define reliable measurement guidelines, specification parameters and characterization data that allows for easier comparison of cameras and image sensors, when choosing a suitable one for a machine vision task. This standard enables the users to evaluate the key performance parameters of digital cameras. The standard includes two categories of measurements: \emph{mandatory} and \emph{optional}. For a camera to be \gls{emva} 1288 compliant, the \emph{mandatory} measurements must be mentioned in the datasheet. Some of the important performance parameters covered by \gls{emva} 1288 include:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Sensitivity: Ability of camera to produce signal in low-light conditions. This measures the capacity of camera to capture weak signals.
        \item \gls{dr}: Range between highest and lowest light levels that a camera can capture. Indicates camera's capacity to capture varying light conditions.
        \item \gls{snr}: Higher \gls{snr} indicates camera's capability to capture better image quality while reducing impact of noise.
        \item Temporal Dark Noise: Noise produced by the camera when there is no incident light.
        \item Temporal Readout Noise: Noise produced when reading the signal from sensor.
        \item Temporal Fixed Pattern Noise: Fixed noise that persists over multiple frames. 
        \item Pixel Non-Uniformity: This assesses the variation in sensitivity among pixels.
        \item \gls{dsnu}: This is the difference in dark signal levels among pixels.
        \item Saturation Capacity: Maximum signal level that can be handled by the pixel or whole image sensor.
        \item Linearity: This indicates the camera's response to change in incident light.
    \end{itemize}

    \section{Laser Speckle Formation}

    Most surfaces are rough on a scale of wavelength of light (with exception of mirrors), and when laser is incident on those surfaces, it is scattered in many different directions because of those surface irregularities (See Fig. \ref{fig:diffuse_reflection}) \cite{wang_2000}. If the surface with incident laser is being imaged, these waves travel in different directions and different distances to reach the image sensor. Speckles are formed on the image sensor plane, when these waves undergo constructive or destructive interference \cite{dhanasekar, goodman_book, briers}. A constructive and a destructive interference results in a bright and dark spot respectively, thus forming the \gls{lsp} as shown in Fig. \ref{subfig:laser_speckle_view_2.jpg}. A typical \gls{lsp} captured using a monochrome camera will look similar to as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:laser_speckle.png}.
    
    % For e.g. in Fig. \ref{fig:green_laser}, with paper having a higher roughness than a polished hard drive surface, it undergoes diffuse reflection when laser is incident on it.

    % \section{Diffraction and Airy Disk}\label{Section:Diffraction}

    % In diffraction, light waves bend around the corners of a slit as shown in Fig. \ref{subfig:diffraction_slit}. In case of circular aperture inside a camera lens, as a result of diffraction, \emph{airy disk} can form on the image sensor (See Fig. \ref{subfig:airy_disk}). The angle $\theta$ at which the first minimum of the light wave, i.e. the first dark ring surrounding the center bright spot, occurs is given by the following formula:

    % \vspace{5mm}
    % \begin{equation}\label{eqn:objective}
    %     \sin \theta \approx 1.22 \frac{\lambda}{d}
    % \end{equation}

    % \vspace{5mm}
    % \noindent where,
    % \begin{itemize}
    %     \item $\theta$ is angle at which first minimum occurs
    %     \item $\lambda$ wavelength of incoming light
    %     \item \emph{d} is diameter of aperture
    % \end{itemize}
    
    % \vspace{5mm}
    % \noindent Hence, as \emph{d} decreases $\theta$ increases, which means the first dark ring appears farther from the center of the bright spot. Another way to frame this is, the bright spot increases in size.

    \section{Template Matching}\label{section:template_matching}
    Template matching a technique employed to track a template or sub-image within a larger image. By sliding the template over the image, a similarity score is calculated at each pixel location of the image. For the purpose of template matching, correlation is often used as a criteria to measure this similarity. The correlation criteria can be categorized into two groups: \gls{cc} and \gls{ssd} correlation criteria \cite{pan_review}.
    
    Pan et. al reviewed different correlation techniques used in \gls{dic} for speckle patterns. They are listed below in Table \ref{table:table_1} and \ref{table:table_2}. 


    

    The overall idea of template matching can be summed with two questions:
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If the specific template or pattern present in the image?
        \item If yes, then where is the pattern's location?
    \end{itemize}

    Before the similarity between template and underlying image is measured

    \subsection*{ZNSSD}
    

    \vspace{5mm}
    \noindent In Fig. \ref{fig:ncc_example}, the template (Fig. \ref{subfig:template.jpg}) is being compared with the image (Fig. \ref{subfig:card.jpg}) that contains this pattern. The process of template matching is performed by comparing each of the pixel values inside the template to the underlying image, using a technique called \emph{squared euclidean distance}. Here, the difference in pixel values for each pixel location between template and the underlying area in the image is squared and added together. The basic idea is, that if this sum has a low value, that is the probable location of template inside the image. The mathematical expression to perform template matching using \gls{ncc} can be found in greater detail in the paper by Lewis \cite{lewis}.

    \noindent Inside Fig. \ref{fig:corr_cmap.png}, the \gls{ncc} match is shown as the bright spot at the location where center of the template matches with the underlying image. The colorbar maps these correlation values such that darkest points inside this figure corresponds to no match and brightest point to the correlation peak.
